Jobs
Jobs represent one-off tasks that run to completion and then stop.
A Job creates one or more Pods and will continue to retry execution of the Pods until a specified number of them successfully terminate. 
As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, 
the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. Suspending a Job will delete its active Pods until the Job is resumed again.
