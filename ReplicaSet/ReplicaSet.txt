ReplicaSet:
A ReplicaSet is an evolution of the Replication Controller with additional features. 
It allows more expressive pod selectors using the matchExpressions field, enabling set-based label selection.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: my-replicaset
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: app, operator: In, values: [my-app]}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: my-image

In this example, the ReplicaSet uses a set-based selector, specifying that the podâ€™s app label should have the value "my-app."

-ReplicaSet introduces set-based selectors with more flexibility.

-ReplicaSet uses matchExpressions for advanced label matching.

-ReplicaSet provides more advanced updating strategies and supports rollbacks.

-ReplicaSet is the recommended choice over Replication Controller in modern Kubernetes deployments.
