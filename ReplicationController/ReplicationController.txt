Replication Controller:
A Replication Controller is one of the older controllers in Kubernetes and is responsible for maintaining 
a specified number of replicas for a pod. It uses the replicas field to define the desired number of identical pod replicas.

apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: my-replication-controller
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: my-image

In this example, the Replication Controller ensures that three replicas of the pod with the label app: my-app are running.

-Replication Controller uses equality-based selectors.

-Replication Controller uses matchLabels for label matching.
