Kubernetes Service Type

1. ClusterIP Services
ClusterIP Services assign an IP address that can be used to reach the Service from within your cluster. 
This type doesn’t expose the Service externally.
ClusterIP is the default service type used when you don’t specify an alternative option.
It’s the most common kind of service you’ll use as it enables simple internal networking for your workloads.

2. NodePort Services
NodePort Services are exposed externally through a specified static port binding on each of your Nodes. 
Hence, you can access the Service by connecting to the port on any of your cluster’s Nodes. 
NodePort Services are also assigned a cluster IP address that can be used to reach them within the cluster, just like ClusterIP Services.
Use of NodePort Services is generally unadvisable. 
They have functional limitations and can lead to security issues:
	Anyone who can connect to the port on your Nodes can access the Service.
	Each port number can only be used by one NodePort Service at a time to prevent conflicts.
	Every Node in your cluster has to listen to the port by default, even if they’re not running a Pod that’s included in the Service.
	No automatic load-balancing: clients are served by the Node they connect to.
When a NodePort Service is used, it’s generally to facilitate the use of your own load-balancing solution that reroutes traffic from outside the cluster.
NodePorts can also be convenient for temporary debugging, development, and troubleshooting scenarios where you need to quickly test different configurations.

3. LoadBalancer Services
LoadBalancer Services are exposed outside your cluster using an external load balancer resource. 
This requires a connection to a load balancer provider, typically achieved by integrating your cluster with your cloud environment. 
Creating a LoadBalancer service will then automatically provision a new load balancer infrastructure component in your cloud account. 
This functionality is automatically configured when you use a managed Kubernetes service such as Amazon EKS or Google GKE.
Once you’ve created a LoadBalancer service, you can point your public DNS records to the provisioned load balancer’s IP address. 
This will then direct traffic to your Kubernetes Service. Therefore, LoadBalancers are the Service type you should normally use 
when you need an app to be accessible outside Kubernetes.
